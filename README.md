# My Introduction

## Hi!!! myself S.Rakshith pursing my Btech at [Amrita vishwa Vidhyapeetham(amritapuri campus)](https://www.amrita.edu/campus/amritapuri) **S1 ECEA**

## I am from Ernakulam,Kerala (From india ofcðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ).
## I am looking forward to learn programming in the first position and also am intrested in created websites and app using FLutter and Android Studios.But still i know a few of the functions and syntaxes in Python.I would say i am basically a noob in the field of programming.I used to keep in mind that i have to complete **A tASK** in a day but wont be able to.I do hrs and hrs of researches which YEAHH literally improved my knowledge.

# Although i havent completed all of the tasks,I have shared my experience on the same .Hope you would enjoy it ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š.Thanks to [Akshat Tripathi](https://github.com/Akshatji800/amfoss-tasks-demo) for his helpfull and wonderful demo repository ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š

## My views about the tasks

#### I honestly would say that these tasks have given me more and more ideas on technologies(both and haradware and software) and also to improve my confidence level a bit more .I wouldnt say that all the tasks given were easy and could be solved without any ease, still some of the tasks like [Flutter]() and [programming]() were quite kind of dfficult for me.Still i have learned many things which i havent learned before and also have come to know more about myself,Cause i havent been this confident ever and also i was lazy ,these tasks took off my laziness and hiked up my curiosity level on doing different tasks.I also have learned a new thing(although i do it,but not that often)**GOOGLING**ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ.And YEAHH!!! day by day i was improving my knowledge



**AMFOSS CLUB THANKS FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE TASKS AND ALSO HELPING ME LEARN THAT THERE ARE THESE NO.OF TECHNOLOGIES IN THIS WORLD!!! THANK YOU!!!!**
