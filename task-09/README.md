# Setup a Simple Personal Website

## Setting up a personal webiste which is a very intresting process actually.I , who learned HTML in my 10th std thought of making this personal website cause i thought that this would help me build a personal website in the future.I would like to share the experience of this particualar task of mine(Wont be a long story thoðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ)

### I learned HTML in my 10th std and found that programming language to be the easiest.Before and all i didnt know C++/Python/Golang and all even existed .I knew that  a programming language C existed cause My seniors in my school used to say that C is the hardest language and also is the programming language for them .
### But me when i saw that HTML is the only language that is the easiest i took cleared many porjects and all in ease which were given in school.I literally forgot all the tags and attributes which is to be used . 
### i have already spent 2Â½ week on the task [Flutter](https://github.com/amfoss/tasks/tree/main/task-6)..So i didnt wanted to give more time on learning and revising the tags and attributes used . But i didnt stop , i recalled the tags and attributes and their uses. 

                                       This was overall a new lot Experience (nothing to add other than thisðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ)
