### Install Ubuntu 20.04 [Desktop]

##### This task although was the simplest of all the tasks given by this club , I faced many issues while installing it.**let me share my experience here**(although not that intresting ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬)
###### First of all MY PC was an old one,which is about 10years(approx) old pc.I  neither have a good pc having a decent GPU nor an "unaffordableðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„" MAC OS.
###### Second of all MY PC , which has a Pentium 4 processor having 3.5Gb of ram and 512Gb of HDD(of course slow) has WINDOWS7 already installed in it ,also which hangs at times and even crashes some timesðŸ¤·.I even thought more than once whether i have to do install ubuntu or not.Finally came to a solution ,**TO INSTALL IT RIGHT AWAY**, as my only aim was to get inside the club

##### Downloaded the file from https://ubuntu.com/#download and now comes the easiest task(for me it was pretty hard ðŸ˜¬,as installing was a big problm for me) **INSTALLING UBUNTU**.Although i have downloaded the file from the [Website](https://ubuntu.com/#download) i used the [rufusapp](https://rufus.ie/en/) and extracted the [ISO](https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&client=ubuntu&q=ISO+file) file to  bootable pendrive.
###### I booted from my pen drive and there's the screen which poped up saying **TRY UBUNTU**  **INSTALL UBUNTU**.
###### I was excited in the beginning as the interface which just showed up which had a CAT in it as the wallpaper.It made me anxious to know the things inside it.I did all the neccesaary things which were shown up in the beginning all gave **INSTALL UBUNTU ALONGSIDE WINDOWS 7**.As the installation setup started i waited for it to complete its installtion(honestly went to have a talk with my neighbour,who is basically my friendðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ) 
###### It was around 2â…› hrs i spoke with him,came back home thinking that the installation preocess would be completed.**BUT SADLY NO!!!!
###### I cancelled the installation and went back to boot up my WINDOWS 7 which **YEAH!!!** *finally got booted up* with no trouble ðŸ˜„.
###### I was damn anxious to see whats inside this linux/ubuntu . Thought for a moment and then came an idea which just striked me like a _thunder_storm_stricking_a_guyðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ.
###### I had another HDD which was unused for decades.I thought to install the whole ubuntu on that particualar HDD.
###### Then again the same steps followed.Then at the installation step,where it asks us to format the disk and install or partition it,i litrally **FORMATTED THE DISK** as this disk was been sitting in here for more than an year.
#### **THE INSTALLATION WAS SUCCESFULLY COMPLETED AND THIS IS WHERE MY JOURNEY BEGAN TO EXPLORE** **UBUNTU**
