# Programming

#### This tasks didnt add up to my intrest cause i am pretty much poor in programming.I didnt find this task easier as i dont know literally anything from the basics of Python/C/C++....I was not even intrested in learning these languages cause i had a very less time to complete **MY FAVORITE TASKS** and as the deadline was nearing made me more nervous ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜¥

## **Will take this seriously, to LEARN programming very soon and this is what my plan is for the next 6months**
