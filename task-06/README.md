## Flutter based UI task

### I have done half of the tats but am stuck at a particular point.I spend around a week to fnd all the nesecarry references.
### My noly aim in this task was to complete this flutter task  as soon as possible and also go for the next one as soon as possible.But that didnt happen.I tried to refer amny references based on the Tabs,sliding of images,addding photos to ur project(placing the photos first in the folder named assets and then naming them ).

### This work took me took up my half the time of the deadline .I was nervous that i wouldnt be able to submit my rest of the task so i dropped this project in the middle.I would like to share the [project](https://github.com/rakshith6404/amfoss-tasks/tree/main/task-06/appdevolpment)

## This experience was a whole lot newer cause learning to built an app which can impress others is totally an amazing task in every aspects.This task made me learn many new things .Although i havent completed this task,I am sure that i have learned something on the making of an app using adnroid studio,Flutter and VS code.
