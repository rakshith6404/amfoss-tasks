## Circuit Design (for Hardware freaks)

### Although i have to use [Tinkercad](http://tinkercad.com/) for all my college works and all , i got a bit intrest in this particualar tinkercad app which made me to start this task.But finally it ended up failing the whole circuit to fail.The car which was parked inside the parking lot was not at all been detected and also ended up in a whole lot of things which didnt make the hardware to detect the things further.
This is my experience on this particular task
